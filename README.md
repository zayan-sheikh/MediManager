# "MediManager" by Zayan Sheikh
**What is it?**

This personal project is intended to be a user-friendly desktop app that helps people who take medication. In the modern
day, many people suffer from mental or chronic illnesses, and as a result, need to take medication, which can be
difficult to keep track of at times. With my project, users will have the ability to add medications
that they are taking through the user interface, which will note information such as:
-  their dosages
- how many refills they have remaining
- the time they were last taken
- how often they are to be taken
- if they are to be taken with food
- the  remaining number of pills they have

**What can it be used for, and who will use it?**

As mentioned earlier, this app is catered towards anyone who takes any sort of medication at all, but will of course be
most useful to those who suffer from health issues that cause them to take many medications at the same time in a long
term schedule (e.g., diabetics, cancer patients, people who take medication for mental health, etc.) This project may
also be useful to healthcare workers, who may need to keep track of patients' medications in a hospital setting. The
application will guide the user in tracking medications, when they will need to be refilled, and when/how they need to 
be eaten. It will even categorize medications based on how they can be obtained, such as "prescription," and "over the
counter," to make the refill process simpler.

*This project is one that I am personally extremely passionate about, as my mother suffers from diabetes. Growing up, 
I witnessed her constantly scrambling to find out which medications she needed to take, which ones she
had already taken, and so much more. In fact, many members of my extended family suffer from similar problems, and it
causes all of them to be inflicted with a degree of stress. To create this application that could potentially lessen 
their stress would bring me great joy, especially if I too may one day suffer the same fate.*
